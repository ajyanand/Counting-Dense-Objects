# Image Processing Pipeline to Count Machine Washer Parts

## Method

[An Image Processing based Object Counting Approach for Machine Vision Application](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.05911.pdf)
 
Since the authors of the above method had not provided any official implementations, we have written our own code to replicate their experiment in our scenario.

### Quick Start

Instructions for running the whole pipeline are given in the .ipynb notebook itself.
