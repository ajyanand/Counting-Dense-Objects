# Counting Objects in Cluttered Environments

This project has been implemented as a requirement for the Final Project for the Fall 2021 iteration of the CIS-680 course at the University of Pennsylvania.

We implement a model to count machine parts bunched up together in a cluttered image.

## Methods
- Image-processing based counting is present in the `image_processing` subfolder
- Mask RCNN based counting is found in the `mask-rcnn` subfolder
- Learning To Count Everything (CVPR 2021) based method is found in the `learning_to_count_everything_cvpr_2021`
- Our deep-learning based depth estimation experiments can be found in the `depth_estimation` subfolder

## Citations
- Citations have been made in the individual README files of the subfolders.
